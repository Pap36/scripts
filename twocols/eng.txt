Hello I like writing lots of nonsense because this makes me feel smarter every day. More than this I feel like having 5000 characters as a Google translate limit feels too low. I mean, what if I decide I want to translate an entire book huh? Honestly someone from google should do something about this. I feel like going mad. Every single day is longer and longer and I just can't stop typing. I think this is where my inspiration ends. Can you believe I wrote all of this without stopping typing? Wow I really am something. Anyways I will have to talk to you later. Bye bye!
